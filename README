Note:
1. start de.legitrust.Applcation.java in IDE or at project root directory execute mvn spring-boot:run
2. There is no database, all dao invoke will do nothing or return empty list.
3. curl -s "http://localhost:8080/cryptocurrency/20171201123030/20171201123030
   curl -s "http://localhost:8080/cryptocurrency/Bitcoin

finish:
1. ScheduledTask will periodically save CryptoCurrencies into database, "fixedRate" can be configured in /resources/application.yml.
2. There is a sql to define creating a cryptocurrency table, if cryptocurrencies and current time are saved in database.
3. In controller: 1. getDataHistrory, 2. getDataByCurrency for task 3 point a and b.

Not finish:
1. Task 3 point c, I don't understand this task, which key should be added on url and send the request? 
   I think, firstly these informations(1h, 24h, 7d) should also be saved in database.
2. Unitest, I can not inject my mock dao for service and controller, so I return always empty list.
   These unittests take me a lot of time.
   
Enhancement:
1. There should add Log system.
2. There should have exception handle.
3. In the database table there is no primary key, this is very bad for search, 
   we can use "id" from response json as primary key.
